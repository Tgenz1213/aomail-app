# COMMON ISSUES
**M365 Licenses Error:**
If you encounter the following error while accessing data:
```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "MailboxNotEnabledForRESTAPI",
    "message": "The mailbox is either inactive, soft-deleted, or is hosted on-premise."
  }
}
```
This error typically indicates that your account does not have the proper license to access the requested data thus you have to pay a M365 license.
